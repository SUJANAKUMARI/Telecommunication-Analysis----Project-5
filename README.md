## User Analytics in the Telecommunication Industry

We are working for a wealthy investor that specializes in purchasing assets that are undervalued. This investorâ€™s due diligence on all purchases includes a detailed analysis of the data that underlies the business, to try to understand the fundamentals of the business and especially to identify opportunities to drive profitability by changing the focus of which products or services are being offered.

The employer wants us to provide a report to analyze opportunities for growth and make a recommendation on whether TellCo is worth buying or selling.  We will do this by analyzing a telecommunication dataset that contains useful information about the customers & their activities on the network. We will deliver insights you managed to extract to the employer through an easy-to-use web-based dashboard and a written report
